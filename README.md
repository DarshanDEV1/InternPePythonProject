# InternPePythonProject
This is  a simple chatbot project created using python and tkinter and for the sentiment analysis I used textblob which will detect polarity and return results accordingly present inside the list. It will be choosing the responses randomly. In this wikipedia library is also being used to search for summary of any keyword from wikipedia.
While we are searching something in wikipedia tab it will create one another tab next to the last tab with the searched keyword name.
In that tab we can get the whole summary of that searched keyword.
Its a very simple project using OOPs and can be improved with NLTK, Tensorflow, Reinforcement learning, Machine learning and OpenCV to detect
faces and recognize them.
